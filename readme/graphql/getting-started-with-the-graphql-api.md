# Getting started with the GraphQL API



## Notes

- The project now supports GraphQL.
- The GraphQL endpoint URL is `/graphql`.
- The GraphiQL (an IDE for our API) URL is `/graphiql`, which can only be
accessed during development.



## Limitations

- Almost all of the fields in the GraphQL API are accessible only if you're
logged in.
- Authentication (login) is not currently supported in GraphQL. You must login
via the REST API first.
- A static GraphQL API doc is not yet available. Stay tuned for details.
